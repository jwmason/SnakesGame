A simple 2D-plane-based Snake Game implemented in C++.

The Snakes Game is a classic game where the player is placed on a plane, attempting survive while avoiding collisions with snakes.
The game continues until the player either successfully pushes all the snakes off the edge of the plane or collides with a snake.
